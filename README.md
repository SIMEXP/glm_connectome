----------

This is a snapshot of the scripts used to generate the analysis for the above-mentioned publication at the time of production (Spring 2014) of the results reported in the paper. This code is not meant as a toolbox for public use. It is not documented, and many of the options are non-functional or have not been tested. This is a research-grade code, meant to clarify the details of implementation of the algorithms described in the aforementioned paper. The GLM-connectome method is publicly available as part of the [NIAK](https://github.com/SIMEXP/niak) package for the "boss" release 0.12.14 and latter. To run the code, please download NIAK from the [NITRC site](http://www.nitrc.org/frs/?group_id=411).  Some functions also depend on the "Multivariate Distance Matrix Regression" package (see the [tutorial]() to replicate the version used in the paper), as well as the "Network-Based Statistics" toolbox (see this [website]() for download).
